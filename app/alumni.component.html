									<p style="padding-right:5%"> <strong> Alex Cooper </strong> 
										studied with Dr. Nuguid (or Horacio) for seven years from age ten to seventeen (2005-2011). Under Horacio's instruction, he was able to develop both technical and musical proficiency that have greatly helped him in pursuing his own career as a pianist. In addition to taking lessons he also gained lots of experience by attending music festivals in Iowa, Northern Minnesota, and Italy. Since auditioning with the first movement of Mozart's Sonata in C Major at the age of ten, he has grown and progressed significantly to where he is now (learning the Bach/Busoni Chaconne in D minor) as an undergraduate studying piano performance at the University of Iowa. After graduating, he plans on applying to graduate schools.
